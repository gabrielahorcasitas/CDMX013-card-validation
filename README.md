# Credit Card Validation - Project 1 
# By Gabriela Horcasitas
## Buy movie tickets!

***

## 1. Project Summary

To achieve the learning objectives of this project, I carried out
a web application in which a user is asked to validate their card number to
complete the purchase of their movie tickets.

With the type of user and hypothetical company in mind, I used a palette of soft and pastelcolors in pinks and purples. 
Likewise, I used an image with motives
related to cinema, in the same color palette, as a background.

## 2.Final Look of the Project

### The final image of the project in the dom is the following

 ![](<./final.jpg>)

* When obtaining a value equal to true in the "isValid" function,
  the message "Tarjeta validada" is displayed.


 ![](<./valid.jpg>) 

* While getting a value equal to false, the message displayed is
  "Tarjeta inválida, inténtalo de nuevo".

 ![](<./invalid.jpg>) 

### Final Look of the project deployed in GitHub Pages

* For the deployment of the web application with Git Hub Pages, I created a new branch in which 
  I moved the index.html file to the /root folder, modifying within said file the calling/linking 
  paths with the JS and CSS files, and also the folder of images, all of which give style, dynamism
  and interactivity to the user interface..

## 3. UX Research

### Who are the users and objectives in relation to the product? 

* The users are customers of a cinema that distributes films made by women, 
  "CineMorras", who're purchasing tickets for a performance online. 

### How does the product solve the problems/needs of said users?
*By validating the credit card number, the product allows users to purchase their tickets online through this form of payment.

### Summary of feedback received

* In my first DEMO, I was suggested to reduce the start message that tells the user 
  what to do to validate their card, as well as add a navigation bar that would be 
  the web page of the cinema.


* Image of the final prototype after feedback (I made changes directly to the HTML that 
  I didn't manage to put in Figma, I'm still getting to know the last one)
